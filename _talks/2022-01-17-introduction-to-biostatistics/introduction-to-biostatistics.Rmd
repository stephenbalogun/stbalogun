One of my early free training sessions in data analytics. The audience at the time were healthcare workers (mostly resident physicians) but the slides were simplified enough to capture any young learner with basic knowledge of biological sciences.

The slides were designed in R with interactive practice questions. I hope others can find them useful too.
