I was invited by the organizers of [R-Ladies Abuja](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-abuja/events/277486120/) to share my thoughts how I utilize R software within the healthcare industry. I discussed the power of R in designing interactive dashboards and the usefulness, especially during the peak of the pandemic. I also talked about how I use R scripts to automate analysis and how over time, I have organized the scripts into an R package - {tidyndr}.
