Sometimes in August, I had a conversation with the founder of the [Pacesetter Leadership Club](https://thepacesetters.net/) on organizing a free 10-hour virtual introductory workshop for beginners in R, especially those in the healthcare industry. The workshop held online between 11th and 13th October 2021. During the workshop, we discussed:

1. Intro to R

2. Importing data

3. Data cleaning

4. Data transformation

5. Data visualization

6. Data communication
