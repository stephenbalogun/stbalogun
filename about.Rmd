Hello, welcome to my personal website. I am Stephen, a Public Health Expert, Project Manager, Data Scientist and Quality Improvement Expert with more than 10 years of experience. I work with CARITAS Nigeria as the Surveillance and Epidemiology Team Lead on the 4GATES Project. I coordinate the ongoing surveillance activities on the PEPFAR supported HIV/AIDS program across 4 states in the country. I am also responsible for treatment continuity of clients. I utilize my numerous skills to ensure that program objectives are delivered timely with excellent user experience. 

My other engagements include:

1. Starting in January 2022, I became one of the co-organizers of [Abuja R User group](https://www.meetup.com/Abuja-R-User-Group-Meetup/events/)

2. I am involved with the International Society for Quality Healthcare (ISQua) in various capacities. I am one of the ISQua Fellowship Ambassadors, Fellowship Tutors, and Quality Improvement Expert.

3. I am a Country Representative for [HIFA](https://www.hifa.org/) (since 20216).


I love to teach (R, quality improvement and management). At leisure, I enjoy company with friends, reading books and listening to music. You can find out more about me from my [older website](https://taiye.netlify.app/).
